It was the first women's golf tournament at the Olympics since 1900.\\nSixty players played four rounds of stroke play. The field included 57 professionals and three amateurs.\\nThe event was won by Inbee Park of South Korea with a score \\u221216, defeating Lydia Ko from New Zealand and China's Shanshan Feng who won silver and bronze respectively.\\nThe medals were presented by Dick Pound, IOC member, Canada and Antony Scanlon, Secretary General of the IGF.\",\n          \"Modern pentathlon contained five events; pistol shooting, \\u00e9p\\u00e9e fencing, 200.0 metres (656.2 ft) freestyle swimming, show jumping, and a 3.200 kilometres (1.988 mi) cross-country run.\\nThe first three events (fencing, swimming, and show jumping) were scored on a points system. Those points were then converted into a time handicap for the final combined event (pistol shooting and cross-country running), with the points leader starting first and each other competitor having a delayed start based on how many points behind the leader they were. This results in the finish order of the run being the final ranking for the event.\\nUnlike previous games, the fencing event consisted of two rounds: the traditional round-robin stage plus a \\\"bonus round.\\\" In the round-robin, each competitor faced every other competitor in a one-touch bout. The competitors were ranked according to how many victories they earn. The bonus round was held on one piste in a ladder, knock-out system. The two lowest-ranked competitors from the round-robin faced each other in another one-touch bout; the winner was credited with an additional point (round-robin victories being worth 6 points) and advanced to face the next-lowest ranked competitor. This continued, up the ranking ladder, until all competitors had competed in the bonus round.\\nThe swimming portion consisted of a 200-metre freestyle race, with score based on time.\\nThe show jumping competition involved riding an unfamiliar horse over a course with 12 obstacles. The score was based on penalties for fallen bars, refusals, falls, and being over the time limit.\\nThe combined running and pistol shooting events remain unchanged from the new combined format from 2012; athletes face four rounds of shooting each followed by an 800.0 metres (874.9 yd) run. In each of the four rounds of firing, they must shoot five targets, loading the gun after every shot, and then being permitted to resume their running. Misses are not explicitly penalized, but practically result in the competitor taking longer to score five hits. After 70 seconds, even if the competitor has not scored five hits, they move on to the next leg of the run.\",\n          \"The men's pommel horse competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics was held at the HSBC Arena on 6 and 14 August. There were 71 competitors from 36 nations. The event was won by Max Whitlock of Great Britain, the nation's first gold medal in the men's pommel horse (and second in any men's gymnastic competition, preceded shortly by Whitlock's win in the floor exercise).

It was the first time any nation had earned the top two spots in the event since the Soviet Union swept the medals (something no longer possible) in 1952.

In July 2007, Chingiz Huseynzade, chairman of Azerbaijan's National Olympic Committee, told a press conference that a group of economists was working on this issue.  Baku is Azerbaijan's oil-rich capital city, on the shores of the Caspian Sea. The city had become somewhat run down following the chaotic period during which independent Azerbaijan emerged from the former Soviet Union but has been experiencing massive development since a new oil-boom began around 2003. As a city in the crossroads between East and West, Huseynzade suggested that the theme of the games might be \\\"making a better connection between East and West\\\"\\nIn November 2007, the Azerbaijan Organizing Committee established its bid committee, installing first vice premier Yagub Eyubov as head.  To ensure quick turnaround, Sports Minister Azad Ragimov appointed the Caspian American Group to prepare the bid book with the assistance of the government.\\n\\n \\nRecent sports experience included Baku's hosting of the 2007 World Wrestling Championships and the 23rd European Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships at the Heydar Aliyev Sport Complex, named for the former Azeri leader.\\nThe bid was popular with residents, with 91.9% of residents being in favor of the bid.  This was the highest approval rating of any of the applicants, most of which were in the 70s-80s percent range.\\nOne issue that appeals to the IOC is the sports or Olympic legacy of a host nation.  As Azerbaijan has been independent only a short time, naturally, it has a short Olympic history, sending teams since only 1996 and claiming only three gold medalists so far. Meanwhile, its long border with Iran may have caused concerns for a security risk.   However, Iran itself expressed support for the Baku Olympic bid. In addition, the South Caucasus is a region with two other frozen political conflicts, which may have negatively influenced support of the regional Games.\",\n          \"Virgin Islands at the 2016 Summer Olympics\\nAthletics (track and field)\\n\\nAthletes from the Virgin Islands achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event):\\n\\nTrack & road events\\n\\nField events\",\n          \"List of gymnasts at the 2016 Summer Olympics\\nSummary\\n\\nThis is a list of the gymnasts who represented their country at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from  5\\u201321 August 2016. 319 gymnasts across all three disciplines (artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics and trampoline) participated in the Games.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"questions\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 757,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1.What was the gender distribution of athletes from Cameroon at the 2016 Summer Olympics?\",\n          \"1.**Question:** \\nWhat were the reasons for the replacements of Axelle Klinckaert, Liu Tingting, and Lee Go-im in the list of female artistic gymnasts at the 2016 Summer Olympics?\",\n          \"1.What was the final time that Ryan Murphy achieved in the Men's 200 metre backstroke event at the 2016 Summer Olympics?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 758,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1.The men's individual time trial event took place at Pontal, a small peninsula and beach area in the Recreio dos Bandeirantes neighborhood, located in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil during the 2016 Summer Olympics.\",\n          \"1.**Answer:** 319 gymnasts participated in the 2016 Summer Olympics across all three disciplines.\",\n          \"1.**Gregorio Paltrinieri** won the gold medal in the Men's 1500 metre freestyle at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Split the sections into a training and testing set\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"rjGCm58VBSpr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","train_df,test_df=train_test_split(df,test_size=0.2,random_state=42)\n","len(train_df) ,len(test_df)"],"metadata":{"id":"15Vh24a4Dm2b","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719132358517,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2019,"user":{"displayName":"RAHUL KUMAR","userId":"04858592732229532104"}},"outputId":"d833e323-3716-48fc-f090-8c0c9957d7e1"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(607, 152)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["we check that the separator we intend to use isn't present within the contexts\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"u_hc3z_NBoMs"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.context.str.contains('->').sum()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"i10QnIO6Bon9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719132360571,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":317,"user":{"displayName":"RAHUL KUMAR","userId":"04858592732229532104"}},"outputId":"0b708ff1-3d59-4f89-9a1e-0f7b69a0d289"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Create the fine-tuning datasets for Q&A"],"metadata":{"id":"acpbrwfRBxAr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","The fine-tuning dataset is created in the following way.

This was the nation's fourteenth appearance at the Summer Olympics.\\nMoroccan Olympic Committee (French: Comit\\u00e9 Olympique Marocain) fielded a squad of 49 athletes, 29 men and 20 women, across 13 sports at the Games. It was the nation's largest delegation sent to the Olympics without any participants in team-based sports, but third-largest overall in history. Nearly forty percent of the Moroccan delegation competed in the track and field; there was only a single competitor each in slalom canoeing, equestrian, fencing, golf (new to the 2016 Games), and shooting.\\nFifteen athletes on the Moroccan roster competed at the previous Olympics in London, with the rest of the field making their Olympic debut in Rio de Janeiro. Among the nation's athletes were 2012 bronze medalist Abdalaati Iguider in distance running, taekwondo fighter Wiam Dislam (women's +67 kg), Greco-Roman wrestler Zied Ayet Ikram, who competed for Tunisia at the previous Games, and 54-year-old show jumper Abdelkebir Ouaddar, who led his delegation as the oldest competitor and flag bearer in the opening ceremony.\\nFor the second Olympics in a row, Morocco left Rio de Janeiro with only a bronze medal, won by world-ranked pro boxer Mohammed Rabii in the men's welterweight division. Five Moroccan athletes advanced to the finals of their respective sporting events but narrowly missed out of the podium, including Iguider, Dislam, along with her fellow taekwondo teammates Omar Hajjami and Naima Bakkal, and steeplechaser Soufiane Elbakkali.\\nQuestion: 1.What was Indonesia's medal tally at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro?\\nAnswer:\",\n          \"British Virgin Islands at the 2016 Summer Olympics\\nSummary\\n\\nThe British Virgin Islands competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's ninth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics.\\nBritish Virgin Islands Olympic Committee sent the nation's largest delegation to the Games since 1996. Four athletes, one man and three women, were selected to the British Virgin Islands team, participating only in both track and field and swimming. Tahesia Harrigan-Scott (women's 100 m) etched her name into the history books as the first-ever female athlete for the British Virgin Islands to compete in three successive Olympic Games, while the rest of her teammates made their debut in Rio de Janeiro, including shot putter Eldred Henry, 16-year-old swimmer Elinah Phillip (women's 50 m freestyle), and Harrigan-Scott's fellow sprinter Ashley Kelly (women's 200 m), who subsequently acted as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. British Virgin Islands, however, has yet to win its first Olympic medal.\\nQuestion: 1.What was significant about Tahesia Harrigan-Scott's participation in the 2016 Summer Olympics for the British Virgin Islands team?\\nAnswer:\",\n          \"Judo at the 2016 Summer Olympics \\u2013 Men's 90 kg\\nSummary\\n\\nThe men's 90 kg competition in judo at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro was held on 10 August at the Carioca Arena 2.\\nThe gold and silver medals were determined by a single-elimination tournament, with the winner of the final taking gold and the loser receiving silver.
