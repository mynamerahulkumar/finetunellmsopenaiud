It was the first women's golf tournament at the Olympics since 1900.\\nSixty players played four rounds of stroke play. The field included 57 professionals and three amateurs.\\nThe event was won by Inbee Park of South Korea with a score \\u221216, defeating Lydia Ko from New Zealand and China's Shanshan Feng who won silver and bronze respectively.\\nThe medals were presented by Dick Pound, IOC member, Canada and Antony Scanlon, Secretary General of the IGF.\",\n          \"Modern pentathlon contained five events; pistol shooting, \\u00e9p\\u00e9e fencing, 200.0 metres (656.2 ft) freestyle swimming, show jumping, and a 3.200 kilometres (1.988 mi) cross-country run.\\nThe first three events (fencing, swimming, and show jumping) were scored on a points system. Those points were then converted into a time handicap for the final combined event (pistol shooting and cross-country running), with the points leader starting first and each other competitor having a delayed start based on how many points behind the leader they were. This results in the finish order of the run being the final ranking for the event.\\nUnlike previous games, the fencing event consisted of two rounds: the traditional round-robin stage plus a \\\"bonus round.\\\" In the round-robin, each competitor faced every other competitor in a one-touch bout. The competitors were ranked according to how many victories they earn. The bonus round was held on one piste in a ladder, knock-out system. The two lowest-ranked competitors from the round-robin faced each other in another one-touch bout; the winner was credited with an additional point (round-robin victories being worth 6 points) and advanced to face the next-lowest ranked competitor. This continued, up the ranking ladder, until all competitors had competed in the bonus round.\\nThe swimming portion consisted of a 200-metre freestyle race, with score based on time.\\nThe show jumping competition involved riding an unfamiliar horse over a course with 12 obstacles. The score was based on penalties for fallen bars, refusals, falls, and being over the time limit.\\nThe combined running and pistol shooting events remain unchanged from the new combined format from 2012; athletes face four rounds of shooting each followed by an 800.0 metres (874.9 yd) run. In each of the four rounds of firing, they must shoot five targets, loading the gun after every shot, and then being permitted to resume their running. Misses are not explicitly penalized, but practically result in the competitor taking longer to score five hits. After 70 seconds, even if the competitor has not scored five hits, they move on to the next leg of the run.\",\n          \"The men's pommel horse competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics was held at the HSBC Arena on 6 and 14 August. There were 71 competitors from 36 nations. The event was won by Max Whitlock of Great Britain, the nation's first gold medal in the men's pommel horse (and second in any men's gymnastic competition, preceded shortly by Whitlock's win in the floor exercise).

In July 2007, Chingiz Huseynzade, chairman of Azerbaijan's National Olympic Committee, told a press conference that a group of economists was working on this issue.  Baku is Azerbaijan's oil-rich capital city, on the shores of the Caspian Sea. The city had become somewhat run down following the chaotic period during which independent Azerbaijan emerged from the former Soviet Union but has been experiencing massive development since a new oil-boom began around 2003. As a city in the crossroads between East and West, Huseynzade suggested that the theme of the games might be \\\"making a better connection between East and West\\\"\\nIn November 2007, the Azerbaijan Organizing Committee established its bid committee, installing first vice premier Yagub Eyubov as head.  To ensure quick turnaround, Sports Minister Azad Ragimov appointed the Caspian American Group to prepare the bid book with the assistance of the government.\\n\\n \\nRecent sports experience included Baku's hosting of the 2007 World Wrestling Championships and the 23rd European Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships at the Heydar Aliyev Sport Complex, named for the former Azeri leader.\\nThe bid was popular with residents, with 91.9% of residents being in favor of the bid.  This was the highest approval rating of any of the applicants, most of which were in the 70s-80s percent range.\\nOne issue that appeals to the IOC is the sports or Olympic legacy of a host nation.  As Azerbaijan has been independent only a short time, naturally, it has a short Olympic history, sending teams since only 1996 and claiming only three gold medalists so far. Meanwhile, its long border with Iran may have caused concerns for a security risk.   However, Iran itself expressed support for the Baku Olympic bid. In addition, the South Caucasus is a region with two other frozen political conflicts, which may have negatively influenced support of the regional Games.\",\n          \"Virgin Islands at the 2016 Summer Olympics\\nAthletics (track and field)\\n\\nAthletes from the Virgin Islands achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event):\\n\\nTrack & road events\\n\\nField events\",\n          \"List of gymnasts at the 2016 Summer Olympics\\nSummary\\n\\nThis is a list of the gymnasts who represented their country at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from  5\\u201321 August 2016. 319 gymnasts across all three disciplines (artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics and trampoline) participated in the Games.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"questions\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 757,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What was the gender distribution of athletes from Cameroon at the 2016 Summer Olympics?\",\n          \"**Question:** \\nWhat were the reasons for the replacements of Axelle Klinckaert, Liu Tingting, and Lee Go-im in the list of female artistic gymnasts at the 2016 Summer Olympics?\",\n          \"What was the final time for the swimmer who won the bronze medal in the Men's 200 metre backstroke at the 2016 Summer Olympics?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 759,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Some of the factors that contributed to the popularity of Baku's bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics among its residents were:\\n\\n1. **High Approval Rating**: Baku's bid had a very high approval rating among its residents, with 91.9% of residents being in favor of the bid.

Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 7 September 2013.\\nOriginally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled). However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 branding for marketing purposes. It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators. The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.\\nThe Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice. The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\\nNew events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.\\nThe United States topped the medal table by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals. Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.\\n\\nGeneric ingredients:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Some of the new events introduced in existing sports at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX, mixed gender team events in various sports, the return of madison cycling for men, and the introduction of the same event for women.\"}]}\n","{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful wikipedia assitant.
