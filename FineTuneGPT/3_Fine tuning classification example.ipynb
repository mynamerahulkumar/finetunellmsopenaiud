Neither of which says what you are now claiming was \\\"your \\npoint\\\", and neither of which is true.\\n\\n>It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the\\n>mound, the other teams score less runs.

Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these\\nwere completed before the first pitch. :-)\\n\\nAL East\\n1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division\\n2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.\\n3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect\\n4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop\\n5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing\\n6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak\\n7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th\\n\\nAl West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top\\n          4 gets pitching should win it.\\n1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success\\n2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?\\n3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.\\n4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close\\n5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here\\n6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs\\n7.  California Angels - will win no games\\n\\nNL East\\n1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!\\n2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga\\n3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected\\n4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a \\\"team\\\"\\n5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me\\n6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing\\n7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing\\n\\nNL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.\\n1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern\\n2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all\\n3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2\\n4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993\\n5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants\\n6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink\\n7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.\\n\\n\\nNLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting\\n                            what I said in my NL West comment.)\\nALCS  New York d. Minnesota\\n\\nWorld Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be\\n                                     fashionable again\\n\\nNL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff\\nNL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo\\nAL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it\\nAL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))\\n\\n-- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Kenney                                       kenney@tribe.b17d.ingr.com\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"rec.sport.hockey\",\n          \"rec.sport.baseball\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-06-22 10:24:26.596317\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"_vtmnEmITsBb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Data exploration"],"metadata":{"id":"BzhO38fsfL4B"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(sports_dataset['text'][0])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jilqFzFjfOpv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720254843004,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":440,"user":{"displayName":"RAHUL KUMAR","userId":"04858592732229532104"}},"outputId":"4dc04186-786a-4528-a935-e141e1897585"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["From: dougb@comm.mot.com (Doug Bank)\n","Subject: Re: Info needed for Cleveland tickets\n","Reply-To: dougb@ecs.comm.mot.com\n","Organization: Motorola Land Mobile Products Sector\n","Distribution: usa\n","Nntp-Posting-Host: 145.1.146.35\n","Lines: 17\n","\n","In article <1993Apr1.234031.4950@leland.Stanford.EDU>, bohnert@leland.Stanford.EDU (matthew bohnert) writes:\n","\n","|> I'm going to be in Cleveland Thursday, April 15 to Sunday, April 18.\n","|> Does anybody know if the Tribe will be in town on those dates, and\n","|> if so, who're they playing and if tickets are available?\n","\n","The tribe will be in town from April 16 to the 19th.\n","There are ALWAYS tickets available!
