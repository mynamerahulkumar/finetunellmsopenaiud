2020 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The 2020 Summer Olympics, officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad and officially branded as Tokyo 2020, were an international multi-sport event held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan, with some preliminary events that began on 21 July 2021. Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 7 September 2013.
Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled). However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 branding for marketing purposes. It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators. The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.
The Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice. The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.
New events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.
The United States topped the medal table by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals. Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.",623

They were the fourth Youth Olympic Games and the second winter edition. Lillehammer was awarded the games on 7 December 2011 as the only candidate. The games reused venues from the 1994 Winter Olympics; this made Lillehammer the first city to host both regular and Youth Olympics. In addition to Lillehammer, sports were contested in Hamar, Gjøvik and Øyer.",152
2016 Winter Youth Olympics,Host selection,"Lillehammer was the only city to bid for the games. The Norwegian Olympic Committee talked with Norwegian and regional authorities to investigate a bid and ultimately submitted a bid to the IOC. Upon the deadline for bidding, they were the only city to bid. Lillehammer hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics. They bid for the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics, but failed to become a candidate.

On 7 December 2011, the International Olympic Committee selected Lillehammer as the host city of the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.",129
Olympic Games ceremony,Summary,"The Olympic Games ceremonies of the Ancient Olympic Games were an integral part of these Games; the modern Olympic games have opening, closing, and medal ceremonies. Some of the elements of the modern ceremonies date back to the Ancient Games from which the Modern Olympics draw their ancestry. An example of this is the prominence of Greece in both the opening and closing ceremonies. During the 2004 Games, the medal winners received a crown of olive branches, which was a direct reference to the Ancient Games, in which the victor's prize was an olive wreath. The various elements of the ceremonies are mandated by the Olympic Charter, and cannot be changed by the host nation. This requirement of seeking the approval of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) includes the artistic portion of opening and closing ceremonies.
The ceremonies have evolved over the centuries. Ancient Games incorporated ceremonies to mark the beginning and ending of each successive game. There are similarities and differences between the ancient Olympic ceremonies and their modern counterparts. While the presentation of the Games has evolved with improvements in technology and the desire of the host nations to showcase their own artistic expression, the basic events of each ceremony have remained unchanged. The presentation of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies continue to increase in scope, scale, and expense with each successive celebration of the Games, but they are still steeped in tradition.",271
Olympic Games ceremony,Ancient forerunners,"The Ancient Games, held in Greece from ca. 776 BC to ca. 393 AD, provide the first examples of Olympic ceremonies.  The victory celebration, elements of which are in evidence in the modern-day medal and closing ceremonies, often involved elaborate feasts, drinking, singing, and the recitation of poetry.  The wealthier the victor, the more extravagant the celebration.  The victors were presented with an olive wreath or crown harvested from a special tree in Olympia by a boy, specially selected for this purpose, using a golden sickle.  The festival would conclude with the victors making solemn vows and performing ritual sacrifices to the various gods to which they were beholden.
There is evidence of dramatic changes in the format of the Ancient Games over the nearly 12 centuries that they were celebrated.  Eventually, by roughly the 77th Olympiad, a standard 18-event program was established.  In order to open a Games in ancient Greece the organizers would hold an Inauguration Festival.  This was followed by a ceremony in which athletes took an oath of sportsmanship.  The first competition, an artistic competition of trumpeters and heralds, concluded the opening festivities.",247
2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Summary,"The opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics took place on the evening of Friday 5 August 2016 in the Maracanã Stadium, Rio de Janeiro, starting at 20:00 BRT (23:00 UTC). As mandated by the Olympic Charter, the proceedings combined the formal ceremonial opening of this international sporting event (including welcoming speeches, hoisting of the flags and the parade of athletes, as well as a new feature—the presentation of the International Olympic Committee's Olympic Laurel distinction) with an artistic spectacle to showcase the host nation's culture and history. The Games were officially opened by Acting President of Brazil Michel Temer.
Directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas and Andrucha Waddington, the ceremony featured presentations of the history and culture of Brazil, including its landscape and forests, the history of the Brazilian people dating back to the arrival of the Portuguese, music and samba, and the favelas among other aspects. Portions of the ceremony were also dedicated to the topics of environmental conservation and climate change. The ceremony was intended to have a significantly lower cost than those of other recent Olympics, with a reported budget under R$20,433,298 (US$6.5265 million).
The ceremony was praised by the international media for its vivid, diverse performances, emphasis on multiculturalism, and its appeal to the issue of climate change.",283
2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony,Preparations,"The creative directors for the ceremony were Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas and Andrucha Waddington. Brazilian choreographer Deborah Colker prepared a cast of over 6000 volunteers who danced in the opening ceremony. Rehearsals started at the end of May 2016. Meirelles stated that the content of the ceremony would be a vision of Brazil and what he hoped the country would become, and would try to avoid clichés (with certain exceptions, however, such as Carnival).
The ceremonies would have a significantly lower budget than those of other recent Olympics, totalling only 10% of the total budget for the ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Meirelles explained that he would be ""ashamed to waste what London spent in a country where we need sanitation; where education needs money. So I'm very glad we're not spending money like crazy. I'm happy to work with this low budget because it makes sense for Brazil."" Meirelles outlined that because of the lower budget, the ceremony would eschew ""high-tech"" ideas such as moving stages and drones; fellow ceremonies director Leonardo Caetano went on to say that the concept of the ceremony would emphasize ""originality"" over ""luxury"", and ""compensate with creativity, rhythm and emotion"". Rather than a series of expensive props that would only be used for a single sequence, a large portion of the budget was used to install 110 20,000-lumen projectors which were used to cover the floor in images throughout the ceremony.
On 15 July 2016, it was announced that Anitta, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil would perform during the opening ceremony. Gil and Veloso had also participated as creative advisors for the ceremony. Creative director Daniela Thomas explained that their involvement was meant to reflect the best in Brazilian music.",377

Four teams participated in the tournament: Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. As the tournament winner, Sweden qualified for the last available Olympic spot from Europe, joining France and Germany, who had already qualified, as the three UEFA representatives.",107
2016 UEFA Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament,Background,"Same as the qualification process for previous Olympics, UEFA used the FIFA Women's World Cup to determine which women's national teams from Europe qualify for the Olympic football tournament. The three teams from UEFA that progressed the furthest in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup played in Canada, other than ineligible England, would qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics women's football tournament in Brazil. If teams in contention for the Olympic spots were eliminated in the same round, ties were not broken by their overall tournament record, and play-offs or a mini-tournament to decide the spots would be held provisionally in February/March 2016.
England were ineligible for the Olympics as they were not an Olympic nation, although Great Britain did compete in 2012 as the host nation. The Football Association had originally declared on 2 March 2015 its intention to enter and run teams on behalf of the British Olympic Association at the 2016 Olympics should England qualify. Following strong objections from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football associations, and a commitment from FIFA that they would not allow entry of a British team unless all four Home Nations agreed, the Football Association announced on 30 March 2015 that they would not seek entry into the Olympic tournament.
After Norway were eliminated by England in the round of 16 on 22 June 2015, it was confirmed that two of the three spots would go to quarter-finalists France and Germany because there could not be more than three eligible European teams in the quarter-finals. Eventually no other eligible European team reached the quarter-finals, so the four European teams eliminated in the round of 16 (Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland) would compete in the UEFA play-off tournament to decide the last spot.
The last time a play-off was necessary to decide a European spot in the Olympic women's football tournament was when Sweden defeated Denmark over two legs to claim a place in the 2008 Olympics. Same as this time, had England been eligible to enter, they would have qualified as one of the top three UEFA teams in the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, rendering the play-off unnecessary.",422

The match was the first time the two nations had faced each other in a major tournament since Germany knocked out host Brazil in the semi-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Belo Horizonte, beating them 7–1 – Brazil's worst margin of defeat in a World Cup match. 
Both opposing coaches — Rogerio Micale for Brazil and Horst Hrubesch for Germany — downplayed the fact that the gold medal match was a rematch of the World Cup semi-final, dubbed the Mineiraço ([minejˈɾasu]) in Brazil in reference to the Mineirão stadium, which was the venue. Only two players – one on each team – had been in the World Cup squads but had not played in the semi-final. Neymar had been ruled out injured after he suffered a fractured vertebra in a collision with Colombia's Juan Zuniga in the quarter-finals, while Matthias Ginter was an unused substitute.

The top 22 male and top 22 female players on the International Table Tennis Federation's Olympic ranking list as of May 2016 will be qualified for the singles event at the Games. No nation can have more than two players per gender in the singles at these Games, so some players below the twenty-eighth position are given a qualifying place based on ranking.

The remaining ten teams are allotted to the nine highest-ranked NOCs in any continent and to the host nation Brazil (if not qualified by any means) that have two players qualified for the singles.

Modern pentathlon at the 2016 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The modern pentathlon at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro took place from 19 to 20 August 2016 at Deodoro Aquatics Centre, Deodoro Stadium, and Youth Arena.
Thirty-six athletes competed each in the men's and women's events. Initially the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM) proposed that all five events be staged in the same arena. While this did not eventuate, all venues were within approximately 300.0 metres (984.3 ft) of each other.",112
Modern pentathlon at the 2016 Summer Olympics,Format,"Modern pentathlon contained five events; pistol shooting, épée fencing, 200.0 metres (656.2 ft) freestyle swimming, show jumping, and a 3.200 kilometres (1.988 mi) cross-country run.
The first three events (fencing, swimming, and show jumping) were scored on a points system. Those points were then converted into a time handicap for the final combined event (pistol shooting and cross-country running), with the points leader starting first and each other competitor having a delayed start based on how many points behind the leader they were. This results in the finish order of the run being the final ranking for the event.
Unlike previous games, the fencing event consisted of two rounds: the traditional round-robin stage plus a ""bonus round."" In the round-robin, each competitor faced every other competitor in a one-touch bout. The competitors were ranked according to how many victories they earn. The bonus round was held on one piste in a ladder, knock-out system. The two lowest-ranked competitors from the round-robin faced each other in another one-touch bout; the winner was credited with an additional point (round-robin victories being worth 6 points) and advanced to face the next-lowest ranked competitor. This continued, up the ranking ladder, until all competitors had competed in the bonus round.
The swimming portion consisted of a 200-metre freestyle race, with score based on time.
The show jumping competition involved riding an unfamiliar horse over a course with 12 obstacles. The score was based on penalties for fallen bars, refusals, falls, and being over the time limit.
The combined running and pistol shooting events remain unchanged from the new combined format from 2012; athletes face four rounds of shooting each followed by an 800.0 metres (874.9 yd) run. In each of the four rounds of firing, they must shoot five targets, loading the gun after every shot, and then being permitted to resume their running. Misses are not explicitly penalized, but practically result in the competitor taking longer to score five hits. After 70 seconds, even if the competitor has not scored five hits, they move on to the next leg of the run.",471

On November 19, 2015, the International Weightlifting Federation banned Bulgaria from competing at the Rio Olympics due to doping, and took one Olympic entry place from Romania and Uzbekistan because of ""multiple positive cases"" of doping.
On 22 June 2016, the International Weightlifting Federation announced that a number of countries would lose quota places in weightlifting at the Games because of doping violations. IWF then went on to state that if the testing of 'B' samples confirmed any country had three or more violations in the 2008 and 2012 Olympic retesting programme, that country would be suspended from international weightlifting for one year, and would thereby be excluded from the Games in Rio, alongside the already suspended Bulgaria.
IWF clarified that after retesting of 'A' samples from 2008 and 2012 that the three countries therefore scheduled for suspension were Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus. Russia is appealing this decision also to the Court of Arbitration for Sport on 6 July 2016.

Closing the gap between herself and Madeline Groves at the 150-metre turn, she pipped the Australian challenger with a half-stroke swim on the final stretch to a striking gold-medal triumph in 2:04.85. Groves commanded a solid lead through the first half of the race, but could not catch the Spaniard near the wall, stopping just 0.03 seconds behind with a 2:04.88 for the silver. Meanwhile, Japan's Natsumi Hoshi delivered a powerful back-half strategy to hold on the two leaders and repeat her bronze-medal feat from London 2012 in 2:05.20.

Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Qualification,Russian disqualification,"Because of the suspension of the Russian Athletics Federation by the IAAF, due to widespread doping violations, Russia currently will not qualify as a team for these Olympics or other international competitions, and unless this suspension is lifted in time, Russia will be unable to send an athletics delegation to these Games. While Russia will continue to seek further appeals, the IAAF confirmed its decision on 18 June 2016 after a report by a five-member task force which reported that Russia had failed to fully address its ""deep-seeded [sic] culture"" of doping. The IAAF did provide for the possibility of accepting individual Russian athletes who have been sufficiently tested outside of the Russian system. One athlete suggested was Yuliya Stepanova for her efforts to expose the scandal.

The systematic doping that has been ongoing in Russia, it's difficult to pick the clean athletes. As you know, one or two or 100 negative tests does not mean an athlete is clean. History has not shown that is the case.
The IAAF then stated on 24 June, that athletes from Russia seeking ""exceptional eligibility for International Competition under Competition Rule 22.1A"" will be considered and have the permission to compete, ""not for Russia but as a neutral athlete"", following guidelines. These athletes have to clearly and convincingly show that they are not co involved in the Russian system (outside the country and subject to other systems). On 1 July 2016, Yuliya Stepanova became the first neutral athlete to be qualified under these rules. Darya Klishina, who lives in the United States, has also been given permission. They will compete as Independent Olympic Athletes. The Court of Arbitration for Sport confirms that verdict and rejects the appeal of 68 Russian athletes, on 21 July 2016. Whistleblower Stepanova was eventually barred from competing by the IOC, and she was called a traitor and received death threats back at home in Russia.",390
Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Men's 5000 metres,Summary,"Mo Farah entered as the favourite for the race, having won the 2012 Olympic title as well as the last two World Championships 5000 m. He also held the fastest time of the year at 12:59:29 minutes and won the Olympic 10,000 m earlier in Rio. His primary challengers included 2015 World medallists Caleb Ndiku of Kenya and Ethiopia's Hagos Gebrhiwet (with the latter having shown the best form that year). Another Ethiopian, Dejen Gebremeskel (the 2012 Olympic runner-up) was also in the race, as was three-time 5000 m world medallist Bernard Lagat.
The preliminaries delivered a shock as distance running power Kenya placed no athletes in the final.  However, three Kenyan immigrants to other countries ran in the final; Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo and 41-year-old Bernard Lagat of the United States and Albert Kibichii Rop of Bahrain. The East African representation was strong with three Ethiopians in the final (plus Birhanu Balew running for Bahrain).  Uganda qualified two athletes.  Mohammed Ahmed running for Canada, Hassan Mead running for the United States and the defending champion Mo Farah running for Great Britain were born in Somalia.  Andrew Butchart was a second British finalist, and David Torrence, an American-born athlete, ran for Peru.  During the first preliminary heat, Mead's front foot met Farah's back foot, both runners stumbling, Mead crashing to the track.  Farah righted himself and continued on to the finish, qualifying third.   After the race a successful protest was filed by the United States, and Mead advanced to the final as a result. No one was disqualified.
This race was the completion of Farah's attempt to complete the second  Woolworth double (5 and 10).  His race tactics were well known and his results consistent.  Somebody had to do something different in order to beat him.  From the gun in the final, two Ethiopian runners went to the front, while Farah dropped to his customary tail end position.  Dejen Gebremeskel and Hagos Gebrhiwet went to the front and were pushing the pace.  Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo moved in behind them.  Farah sensed the change in tactics and moved up much earlier than normal to a position in the middle of the strung out pack, to watch the action.  While the two Ethiopians were sharing the lead duty, Gebrhiwet was taking the lion's share.  19 year old Joshua Kiprui Cheptegei moved in to mark Farah's moves.  With five and a half laps to go, the situation started to change.  Chelimo moved up, passing Gebrhiwet, who fell back into the field.  Farah used this occasion to hit the front.
Down the backstretch with 4 and a half laps to go, many tried to move to the front to mark Farah, with elbows flying in the tightening pack.  From this point Farah began to control the race, with Rop, Chelimo, the third Ethiopian Muktar Edris, Mead, Gebremeskel, Gebrhiwet, Cheptegei, Butchart, Ahmed and Lagat all in a row behind Farah.  During the next lap and a half Butchart moved closer to Farah on the outside, then with almost 3 laps to go, went around the outside and onto Farah's shoulder, creating a British team wall similar to the blocking techniques the Kenyans usually use.  Cheptegei then moved to the outside of the wall making it three wide.  Butchart  was only able to stay there for about a half lap before falling back into the pack, but Cheptegei remained in place.  Edris was looking for a way around.		
With a lap and a half to go, Cheptegei tried to speed up to go around Farah, but Farah exactly matched his speed.  The rules of the road were clearly explained to the youngster, do not pass.  Finally Gebrhiwet, bounced out of the pack several places behind at the same time Edris moved, the two collided with Edris bouncing sideways as Gebrhiwet made the bold move around Cheptegei and was ahead of Farah at the line and sprinting.  He didn't want to give Farah the opportunity to get the jump on him like in the two previous World Championships.  In the next 50 metres, Farah explained the rules of the road to him too, the two exchanging elbows as Farah would not let Gebrhiwet to move to the inside.  When Gebrhiwet relented Chelimo filled the space between him and the curb, right behind Farah.  Down the final backstretch, Gebrhiwet tried one more time, elbowing Chelimo as he went by with Chelimo losing his balance for a moment, then making contact with Ahmed following Gebrhiwet.  Getting untangled, Chelimo ran down the backstretch after Gebrhiwet, who still couldn't get around Farah.  Gebrhiwet slowed a little, Chelimo was again pinned to the curb, more contact with Ahmed as Chelimo was looking for running space.		
Chelimo moved to the outside, leaving Gebrhiwet on the curb behind Farah.  Edris elbowed his way inside of Ahmed as he passed.  After all the contact, Chelimo was in the perfect position to sprint past Farah on the home stretch.  Chelimo almost got to Farah's shoulder but Farah accelerated again, pulling away to the win by five metres, still looking over his shoulder to make sure there was no further challenge.	
Chelimo finished second, Gebrhiwet, Edris, Ahmed and Lagat.
Farah knelt and kissed the track.  After the celebration and victory lap, it was announced that Chelimo, Ahmed and Edris were disqualified, giving Gebrhiwet the silver and Lagat the bronze.  Being interviewed on American television, Chelimo was shocked.  An appeal was filed and the decision was mostly reversed.  Chelimo was reinstated as the silver medalist, Ahmed was also reinstated when it was found that they did not break the rules while Edris' disqualification would stand.

In qualifying, 2 athletes ran under 51 seconds, American Phyllis Francis and Oluwakemi Adekoya, who ran a Bahraini record. Another Nigerian born Bahraini, 18-year-old Salwa Eid Naser,  won her heat in a personal best.
In the final, Natasha Hastings made up most of the stagger on one of the favorites, Shaunae Miller and held the lead to the halfway point. Miller made up the stagger on Stephenie Ann McPherson in lane 8 to her outside. Starting about 150 metres into the race, Miller accelerated, passing Hastings before the halfway point in the far turn.  In lane 4, Allyson Felix ran an even pace which saw her separate from the athletes inside of her and catching Shericka Jackson late in the second turn. Coming off the turn, Miller held a clear 2 metre advantage over Hastings, with Felix gaining on Hastings and Jackson more than a metre behind Felix. Hastings was passed by Felix who continued to gain on Miller.  In the last few metres as Felix gained on her, Miller started to lean forward trying to get to the finish line.  As Felix looked to pass her in the final step, Miller made a last desperate headlong dive across the line. The photo finish revealed her shoulders had crossed the line seven hundredths of a second ahead of Felix. Jamaican Shericka Jackson finished 3 metres back for bronze.		
Felix's silver became her seventh Olympic medal. She would later earn two more Olympic gold medals as part of the winning 4x100 meters and 4x400 meters teams, tying her with Merlene Ottey as the most decorated woman in track and field history, with nine Olympic medals.",399

In the second round Tianna Bartoletta moved into silver medal position with a 6.94 m. Defending champion Brittney Reese jumped a 6.79 m, her only legal jump of the first four rounds, but remained outside of the medals. In the third round, Bartoletta's 1 cm improvement to 6.95 m equalled Španović, with the tiebreaker to put her in gold medal position. On the next jump, Balta equalled Reese, with the same tiebreaker rule pushing her into fifth place. 
The fifth round had the real action. First Reese jumped 7.09 to leap from fifth to first. Her mood went from serious to jubilant. Mihambo jumped the third 6.95 of the competition. Then Španović moved right behind Reese with a 7.08 m, her personal best and a new Serbian national record.

Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's 3000 metres steeplechase,Summary,"Tunisia's Habiba Ghribi returned to defend her 2012 Olympic steeplechase title, though she was outside the top 15 runners on the seasonal lists. The fastest time was held by Ruth Jebet of Bahrain, whose 8:59.97 minutes at the Prefontaine Classic at the end of May made her the second fastest ever in the discipline. The 2015 World Champion Hyvin Jepkemoi of Kenya was four hundredths of a second behind her in that race and had become the third fastest, while America's Emma Coburn had set a national record and was third ranked entering the competition. Ethiopians Etenesh Diro and Sofia Assefa and Kenya's Beatrice Chepkoech rounded out the top six. Gesa Felicitas Krause, a 2015 World medalist and 2016 European Champion, was her continent's best entrant.
Before the competition even began, entrant Silvia Danekova failed a doping test after her arrival in Rio.  She submitted an appeal the Court of Arbitration for Sport where she was ruled ineligible for the race.
In the first round Jebet broke clear of the pack, ran her own race, and easily won her heat over Assefa and Krause. Chepkoech, Ghribi and Coburn took the top qualifying spots in the second race. Jepkemoi won the third and slowest heat, with Genevieve LaCaze and Courtney Frerichs taking the automatic qualifying spots. Etenesh Diro lost her shoe in that race after being stood on by an opponent and ran the remainder of the race barefoot; she failed to make the qualifying time but progressed upon appeal, as did Aisha Praught and Sara Louise Treacy. Four national records were broken, including Lalita Shivaji Babar's 9:19.76 minutes for India.
The strategy in this final was prefaced by the Prefontaine race in Eugene.  In that race, Jebet broke away but was chased down by a last lap kick by Jepkemoi that almost caught her at the line.  Coburn watched the chase from ten seconds back while setting the American record.  Here Jebet knew she needed to create a bigger cushion to discourage Jepkemoi from chasing.  After settling for just being near the front of the pack for the first two laps, Jebet accelerated with one barrier and five laps to go. Only three athletes, Jepkemoi, Chepkoech and Coburn, took off in pursuit, the rest of the field stringing out behind an ever-widening gap.  After a 68-second lap, then a 69-second lap, Jebet had a 3-second lead on the Kenyan teammates with Coburn another 3 seconds back.  After a 70-second lap, Chepkoech began to lose contact with her teammate.  An encouraged Coburn set off in pursuit of a medal, passing the slowing Chepkoech with 1 and 3/4 laps to go. During the 71-second following lap, while Jebet was slowing slightly from the strain, Jepkemoi was consistently losing ground and Coburn could see she was close to Jepkemoi.  Jepkemoi did not take off in hot pursuit of Jebet, more concerned with the challenge from behind.  On the final backstretch, Coburn passed Jepkemoi for a few moments before Jepkemoi accelerated away going into the final water jump.  Jebet cruised home unchallenged with a final lap just under 71, crossing the line in 8:59.75.  Forgetting about Jebet, Jepkemoi used her best sprinting to beat Coburn to the line by a half second for silver.  Coburn set the North American Continental Record 9:07.63 in third. 		
Jebet's time slightly improved her second best time in history, moving to less than a second of the world record.  Coburn's time made her the number 8 performer in history.  Even deeper down the list of finishers, there were many personal bests.  Fourth place Chepkoech became #22 on the all-time list, sixth place Gesa Felicitas Krause became #31, seventh, eighth and ninth places  Madeline Hills, Colleen Quigley and Genevieve LaCaze became #38, #42 and #43 respectively.
The medals were presented by Paul Tergat, IOC member, Kenya and Anna Riccardi, Council Member of the IAAF.
Less than two weeks later, Jebet would set the world record, improving her personal best by almost seven seconds and the world record by six.
Ruth Jebet has been suspended since February 2018 for testing positive for EPO, although her Olympic results are unaffected.",1017
Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's triple jump,Summary,"Before the competition, 2015 World Champion Caterine Ibargüen of Colombia had the longest jump of the season with 15.04 m. Kazakhstan's Olga Rypakova entered as the defending Olympic champion from 2012 and had been the first athlete to beat Ibargüen that year, ending her rival's 34-meet-long winning streak. Twenty-year-old Venezuelan Yulimar Rojas was the only other athlete over fifteen metres that season and had won the 2016 World Indoor Championships. The remaining top challengers formed the 2016 European Championships podium – Patrícia Mamona of Portugal, Greek jumper Paraskeví Papahrístou (third on the world rankings), and 2015 world medallist Hanna Knyazyeva-Minenko of Israel.

All the main contenders progressed with Germany's Kristin Gierisch and Finn Kristiina Mäkelä posting the next best marks. A 2012 Olympic medallist and former world champion, Olha Saladuha of Ukraine, failed to progress.

Four jumps later, defending champion Olga Rypakova edged ahead with 14.73 m.  The final jumper in every round of the competition, Caterine Ibargüen moved into bronze medal position with 14.65 m.  In the second round, Ibargüen took the lead she would never relinquish, with a 15.03 m.  In the third round Yulimar Rojas jumped 14.87 m to take over the silver medal position she would not relinquish.  Rojas jumped her best in the fourth round, 14.98 m (49 ft 1+3⁄4 in) and Ibargüen followed that with her best of 15.17 m (49 ft 9 in).

Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Men's 3000 metres steeplechase,Summary,"Continuing the country's unbeaten tradition in the Olympic steeplechase since 1968, the principal challengers to the gold medal came from the Kenyan team. Ezekiel Kemboi returned to defend his 2012 Olympic title and had won almost every global final since 2003. His sole loss came at the 2008 Beijing Olympics to another member of the team Brimin Kipruto. The third Kenyan was Conseslus Kipruto, who was the 2015 World Championships runner-up and held the top three times that season, having won all of the 2016 IAAF Diamond League meets. The next highest ranked entrant at sixth was Bahrain's John Kibet Koech (himself a former Kenyan). The 2012 Olympic runner-up Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad was also present.
In the past Kemboi has sported the frohawk, but at the start line for the final, the 34-year-old man was sporting the reverse mohawk. His prince in training, Conseslus Kipruto has watched his act from behind in the previous two world championships as had many other men in this field. Conseslus made it clear from the gun that this was not going to be a strategic race, rushing to the lead. Returning silver medalist Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad immediately moved to cover the lead, while Evan Jager ran around the outside of the pack to join them at the front 200 metres into the race. By the first barrier, the race was already a string, rather than a pack. Over the next lap, Conseslus pressed the pace, with only Jager following.  A gap opened back to the string of chasers, with Kemboi in the middle of the field. Through the next lap Jacob Araptany and Yemane Haileselassie trying to bridge the gap to Jager but also battling each other for the third position. 2008 gold medalist Brimin Kipruto moved up to join the challenge for third with Kemboi gliding along the inside to join the back of the leaders. The gap was disappearing. Suddenly at the last barrier before the end of the third lap, Araptany didn't appear to be prepared for the barrier, he just went down sliding under the barrier, his chin taking a knockout blow from the barrier with an audible crash. Following the next water jump, Jager moved past Conseslus, the pair tracked by Kemboi, Kenyan ex-pat Hillary Bor and Brimin.  With Jager now pushing the pace, the gap again began to form, with just Conseslus and Kemboi in the lead group.
Prefaced by the 2015 Steeplechase at Paris, Jager had learned he could beat the Kenyans by pushing the pace early. Here he was attempting to do just that. After another lap and a half of this, the gap grew back to fourth place Bor, with Brimin falling back and Mekhissi-Benabbad at the tail of the second group. With less than two laps to go Amor Ben Yahia in the middle of the second group fell over the barrier, leaving Soufiane El Bakkali, Brimin, Bor, Mekhissi-Benabbad and Yoann Kowal the remaining string of chasers. Jager held the lead to just before the bell. Over the penultimate water jump, Kemboi moved into the marking position, but after the following barrier, Conseslus gathered himself and sprinted by both. Kemboi chased Conseslus to the barrier before the backstretch, to be in the perfect position to launch his patented surge. But the surge was not there for Kemboi, instead it was Conseslus who made the surge down the backstretch. By the final water jump, the gap was insurmountable and Conseslus knew it. He began waving to the crowd. Conseslus ran the final straight, arms outstretched celebrating his victory (as Kemboi had done before him). Behind him, Jager was not done, executing his final kick around the beaten Kemboi on the home stretch and pulling away to the silver medal. Kemboi jogged across the finish line in third. Well behind, Mekhissi-Benabbad used the same kind of final lap that had brought him to two previous silver medals to beat the group of chasers to the line in fourth.
After the race was over, the French team filed a protest, claiming Kemboi had stepped off the track following the first water jump.  Video was reviewed of the race and the foul was detected, causing Kemboi to be disqualified, advancing Mekhissi-Benabbad to the bronze medal. That also made Mekhissi-Benabbad and not Kemboi, the first man to win three Olympic medals in the steeplechase.  This was Kenya's ninth straight and eleventh overall gold medal in the steeplechase. Jager was the first American to win a medal in the steeplechase since Brian Diemer in 1984.
After dominating the event, with two Olympic gold medals, four World Championship gold medals (and three silvers before that), Ezekiel Kemboi announced his retirement after the race, only to retract it and compete for one more year after realizing that he was disqualified.
The medals for the competition were presented by Aïcha Garad Ali, Djibouti, member of the International Olympic Committee, and the gifts were presented by Bernard Amsalem, Council Member of the IAAF.",1164

The second thrower was Johannes Vetter who topped it with an 85.32 m.  The eighth thrower in the round was reigning World Champion Julius Yego, who tossed it 88.24 m (289 ft 6 in), landing on his hands to avoid a face plant on the runway.  He moved into the gold medal position.  The next competitor was the number one thrower in 2016, Thomas Röhler who answered with an 87.40 m to move into silver position.  On his second attempt, Walcott threw it 85.38 to move into bronze position by just 6 cm, still more than 3 metres short of the mark he threw in the qualifying round.  Nobody was able to improve in the next two rounds.  As the final thrower in the fourth round, Yego twisted his left ankle during his fouled attempt.  He limped to the bench and was wheelchair out of the stadium still in gold medal position.  On his fifth attempt, Röhler threw it 90.30 m (296 ft 3 in), less than a foot short of the Olympic record, to move ahead of Yego.  Nobody was able to improve their position in the final round and the gold medal was confirmed.  After treatment, Yego limped back into the stadium to congratulate Röhler and celebrate his silver medal by limping around his victory lap.

Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's 400 metres hurdles,Summary,"The 2012 Olympic champion Natalya Antyukh could not have entered due to Russia's team doping ban. Of the medallists from the 2012 Olympics and 2015 World Championships only Czech athlete Zuzana Hejnová was present, though her form had been lacking that season. The three American medallists of that period did not qualify at the American trials, which were headed by Dalilah Muhammad in a world-leading 52.88 seconds. Top-four ranked Shamier Little and Georganne Moline were beaten by Ashley Spencer and 16-year-old Sydney McLaughlin there. Janieve Russell of Jamaica ranked third for the season but had fitness issues during preparation. Eilidh Doyle, Sara Slott Petersen and Wenda Nel were the only other entrants with times under 54.5 seconds that year.
In the final, Dalilah Muhammad went out aggressively, with a clear lead over the first hurdle. She made up the stagger on Sara Petersen to her outside before the end of the first turn. When they hit the backstretch the positions revealed Peterson was clearly out second best. She continued to lead down the backstretch and through the turn, with Peterson trying to keep pace from behind with further to run around the turn. It is an all or nothing strategy, the only question is if she would tie up in the last 100. Muhammad had to stretch her strides to get over the eighth hurdle, a tip to Petersen that Muhammad might come back. Petersen made a run at Muhammad, perhaps achieving a slight gain between the ninth and tenth hurdle.  But Muhammad did not tie up, the gap didn't shrink and Muhammad had a clear victory. At the eight hurdle, two time world champion and the only returning medalist from 2012 Zuzana Hejnová and Janieve Russel were in a battle for bronze. Ashley Spencer and Eilidh Doyle were in a battle for dead last place, 3 metres behind the bronze medal battle. Over the last two hurdles, Russel faded, while Hejnová stayed about the same distance behind Petersen. But Spencer was in a different gear, running the last hundred like a 100-metre hurdler, passing three Jamaicans and Hejnová then continuing her rush, making a run at Petersen.
Petersen broke her own Danish National Record while winning silver.
The following evening the medals were presented by Nita Ambani, IOC member, India and Nawal El Moutawakel, Council Member of the IAAF.",518

It had been introduced along with the men's 200 metres hurdles in 1900, with the 200 being dropped after 1904 and the 400 being held through 1908 before being left off the 1912 programme.

Swimming at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metre freestyle,Summary,"After a runner-up feat in the 400 m freestyle two days earlier, China's Sun Yang put up a monumental effort for the Olympic mid-distance freestyle title in a race against Chad le Clos of South Africa and Conor Dwyer of the United States. Hanging with the leaders at the 150-metre turn, Sun made a late charge on the final lap to edge out Le Clos in front and did not let Dwyer pass him for the gold medal in 1:44.65. Despite his early jump to the immediate lead before the final stretch, Le Clos could not hold off Sun to finish with a silver and an African record time in 1:45.20. Meanwhile, Dwyer powered home with a bronze in 1:45.23. Sun was the sixth man to win multiple medals in the event. Le Clos's silver was South Africa's first medal in the men's 200 metre freestyle.
Swimming on the outside lane, 2015 World champion James Guy of Great Britain improved upon his position to finish fourth with a 1:45.49. Dwyer's teammate Townley Haas claimed the fifth spot in 1:45.58, while Germany's world record holder Paul Biedermann (1:45.84), Japan's Kosuke Hagino (1:45.90), the Olympic champion in the 400 m individual medley, and Russia's Aleksandr Krasnykh (1:45.91) rounded out the field.

Indonesia at the 2016 Summer Olympics,Summary,"Indonesia competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's fifteenth appearance at the Summer Olympics.
The National Sports Committee of Indonesia (Indonesian: Komite Olahraga Nasional Indonesia, KONI) confirmed a team of 28 athletes, 17 men and 11 women, to compete across seven sports at the Games. Three of them obtained their spots to compete in athletics and swimming through wild card entries, with the rest of the team directly qualifying for the Games on merit. Among the sporting events the nation competed in, Indonesia made its Olympic debut in men's team archery and BMX cycling, as well as its return to rowing after 12 years.
The Indonesian roster featured ten returning Olympians, with three of them headed to their third straight Games: badminton shuttler Liliyana Natsir, along with her partner Tontowi Ahmad, in the mixed doubles, and two-time bronze medalists Eko Yuli Irawan and Triyatno in weightlifting. Other notable Indonesian athletes included Beijing 2008 champion Hendra Setiawan in the men's badminton doubles and long jumper and reigning Asian Games champion Maria Natalia Londa, who was appointed as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

2016 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The 2016 Summer Olympics (Portuguese: Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016), officially the Games of the XXXI Olympiad (Portuguese: Jogos da XXXI Olimpíada) and officially branded as Rio 2016, were an international multi-sport event held from 5 to 21 August 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with preliminary events in some sports beginning on 3 August. Rio de Janeiro was announced as the host city at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009.
11,238 athletes from 207 nations took part in the 2016 Games, including first-time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team. With 306 sets of medals, the Games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five separate venues in the Brazilian cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus.
These were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America, as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America (the second being 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina), and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. These were also the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.
The United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (121); the U.S. team also won its 1,000th Summer Olympic gold medal. Great Britain finished second and became the first country to increase its tally of medals in the Summer Olympiad immediately after being the host nation. China finished third in the medal table. Host nation Brazil won seven gold medals and 19 total medals, its best result at any Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Bahrain, Fiji, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan, and Vietnam all won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).",476
2016 Summer Olympics,Bidding process,"The bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics was officially launched on 16 May 2007. The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13 September 2007, confirming their intention to bid. Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. Others included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time.
Nawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids, which was awarded to London, United Kingdom. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.
Many safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.

Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense. It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign.
The final voting was held in Copenhagen on 2 October 2009, with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro considered favorites to secure the Games. Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.",533
Tokyo bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The Tokyo bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics was an unsuccessful bid, first recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on September 14, 2007. The IOC shortlisted four of the seven applicant cities—Chicago, United States; Madrid, Spain; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Tokyo, Japan; over Baku, Azerbaijan; Doha, Qatar; and Prague, Czech Republic—on June 4, 2008 during a meeting in Athens, Greece. This was followed by an intensive bidding process which finished with the election of Rio de Janeiro at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on October 2, 2009.
Tokyo earned the top scores during the Applicant phase, after a detailed study of the Applicant Files received by the IOC Working Group on January 14, 2008. Between April 16 and April 19, 2009, the IOC Evaluation Commission, led by Nawal El Moutawakel, arrived in Tokyo to assess the conditions of the city. The Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city. Tokyo was eliminated in the second round of voting with only 20 votes in a three-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC.
The Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC) nominated Tokyo over Fukuoka as its candidate city to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on August 30, 2006. This is the country's third failure, after two failed attempts for the 1988 and the 2008 Summer Olympics. Recent Olympic Games in Asia as the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, hurt Tokyo's bid. In 2013, Tokyo was selected to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, marking the second Summer Olympics in Japan, after the 1964 Summer Olympics, and the fourth hosted in Japan, after the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo and the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.",384
Refugee Olympic Team at the 2016 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The Refugee Olympic Team competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016, as independent Olympic participants.
In March 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach declared that the IOC would choose five to ten refugees to compete at the 2016 Summer Olympics, in the context of the ""worldwide refugee crisis"", of which the European migrant crisis is a prominent part. Additionally, as part of an effort ""to show solidarity with the world's refugees"", the United Nations Refugee Agency selected Ibrahim Al-Hussein, a Syrian refugee residing in Athens, Greece, to carry the Olympic flame through the Eleonas refugee and migrant camp in the city as part of the 2016 torch relay.
Initially, the team was named ""Team of Refugee Olympic Athletes"", with the IOC country code ROA, but in June 2016 this was changed to Refugee Olympic Team with the country code ROT.
The athletes officially competed under the Olympic Flag. The Refugee Nation flag was also used in an unofficial capacity to represent the team.",220
Refugee Olympic Team at the 2016 Summer Olympics,Team selection and funding,"The IOC identified 43 potential candidates for inclusion in the team with the final selection to take into account sporting ability, personal circumstances, and United Nations-verified refugee status. In order to pay for athlete training, a fund of US$2 million was created by the IOC. National Olympic Committees (NOCs) were then asked to identify any displaced athletes in their countries who might be able to reach Olympic standard.
An initial three athletes were identified as potential competitors for Rio; Yusra Mardini, a 17-year-old Syrian swimmer, who crossed from Turkey into Greece in an inflatable boat (swimming after its motor had stopped) before crossing Europe by train through mainland Greece, the Balkans, Hungary and Austria to eventually reach Germany where she now lives and trains; Raheleh Asemani, an Iranian taekwondo athlete training in Belgium; and judoka Popole Misenga, originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo but now living in Brazil. Mardini and Asemani have received IOC Olympic Solidarity scholarships. Asemani was later granted Belgian citizenship and applied to compete instead for the Belgian team, with International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach saying that such permission was expected to be granted.
Additional candidates were identified: among refugees of the Syrian Civil War, cyclists Ahmad Badreddin Wais and Nazir Jaser and triathlete Mohamad Masoo; and in Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, where a support program run by former marathon world record holder Tegla Loroupe identified 23 athletes.

On 3 June 2016, the IOC announced a team of ten athletes would compete as part of the refugee team at the Games. The team was led by Loroupe, who acted as a ""peace ambassador"". Rose Lokonyen was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony, and judoka Popole Misenga was chosen to carry the flag for the closing ceremony.",403
Prague bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,Summary,"Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic, bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Prague's bid was considered a trial bid to warm up for future Olympic campaigns. Prague's bid came to an end on 4 June 2008, when it failed to make the Candidate city shortlist.
After initial enthusiasm, Prague's bid became troubled, and the city considered canceling their bid.  Nevertheless, the government went forward with its bid to become an applicant city on 14 January 2008.
If it had been chosen, Prague would have staged the Games between 29 July and 14 August. The subsequent Paralympics were to be held between 1 and 13 September.",136
Prague bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,Bid Details,"On 22 March 2007 Prague confirmed its bid when the Prague Assembly voted 53-10-3 in support of launching an official bid.  Tomas Petera was the head of the Praha Olympijska (Olympic Prague) company.
This was the third try by Prague and the Czech Republic to host the Olympic Games. Previously Prague placed a bid for 1924 Summer Olympics which was won by Paris and planned a bid for 1980 Summer Olympics but Warsaw Pact invasion and normalization put an end to these plans; the Olympics were hosted by Moscow. Useful recent experience includes the recent hosting the 2004 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships.
The Czech Republic (including Moravia, Silesia and Bohemia) has a strong sports legacy, which appeals to the IOC.  They have attended every games except the Athens 1896 Games and the Los Angeles 1984 Games.  The Czechs have been especially proficient in gymnastics, and for winter sports, ice hockey. The current decathlon world champion is Czech Roman Šebrle, who as tradition dictates, holds the title of ""World's Greatest Athlete"" and who was identified to be a potential face of the Games.
Prague is known as one of the most beautiful cities in Europe,
and as a popular tourist destination, it holds many of the cultural aspects that appeal to the IOC. The bid book indicates around 38,000 hotel rooms are planned by 2016, but this amount is short of IOC expectations and is far behind competing bids.
Prague allocated 45 million crowns to the Olympic movement for studies, advertisements, and opinion polls.   The bid budget of US$22 million allotted for the application and candidacy phase was roughly half that of other bids.",351
Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics was an unsuccessful bid, first recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on September 14, 2007. The IOC shortlisted four of the seven applicant cities—Madrid, Spain; Tokyo, Japan; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Chicago, United States; over Baku, Azerbaijan; Doha, Qatar; and Prague, Czech Republic—on June 4, 2008, during a meeting in Athens, Greece. This was followed by an intensive bidding process which finished with the election of Rio de Janeiro at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on October 2, 2009.
In Chicago's bid, the games would have been held from July 22 to August 7, with the Paralympics held between August 12 and 28. The bid plan emphasized use of Chicago Park District parks to host the games, but other existing facilities such as Soldier Field and McCormick Place would have hosted events. The bid included a plan for North Side, Downtown Loop and South Side celebration locations that would have had high-definition LED screens for unticketed visitors. The bid noted that there was a very high concentration of event locations and training facilities close to each other and that the majority of event sites were clustered together. Thus, the vast majority of athletes would have been close to their competitions.
Chicago earned a general score of 7.0 during the Applicant phase, after a detailed study of the Applicant Files received by the IOC Working Group on January 14, 2008. Between April 4 and 7, 2009, the IOC Evaluation Commission, led by Nawal El Moutawakel, arrived in Chicago to assess the conditions of the city. The Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File, and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city. 
Though considered a favorite entering the voting process, and despite personal appeals from such high-profile Chicagoans as U.S. President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey, the bid faced considerable organized grassroots opposition, including from the coalitions No Games Chicago and the Unlympics Organizing Committee. Opponents cited the history of cost overruns pervasive to Olympic bids in a time of considerable public debt and the sentiment that funds for the Olympics should instead fund public schools and public clinics.  Surveys of Chicagoans in the run-up to the bid saw support for the bid fall below 50%, and Chicago was eliminated on the first ballot in IOC voting on October 2, 2009, with 18 votes in a three-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC.
On October 2, 2009, Chicago was knocked out in the first round of voting, and the Olympics went to Rio de Janeiro, despite some high-profile backers, such as US President Barack Obama and Chicago-based television hostess Oprah Winfrey, going to Copenhagen to support the bid. Seven years later, the 2016 state-funded Olympics in Rio proved to be a financial disaster, and many argued that privately-funded games in Chicago, where most of the venues were existing or temporary ones, would have fared far better.
The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) selected Chicago over Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and San Francisco as its candidate city to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2016 Summer Paralympics on April 14, 2007. This is the city's third failure, after two failed attempts for the 1952 and the 1956 Summer Olympics (and fourth overall attempt, as Chicago won the 1904 Olympics, but they were moved to St Louis as the World's Fair was there and threatened to host a competing competition if the Olympics were not moved). Olympic Games in North America, including the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, hurt Chicago's bid. It would have been the ninth Olympics hosted in the United States, after the 1904, 1932, 1984 and 1996 Summer Olympics; and the 1932, 1960, 1980 and 2002 Winter Olympics.
After Chicago's failure, the United States will not host the Olympics until the 2028 Summer Games when Los Angeles hosts the Summer Olympics for the third time.",837
Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,USOC city selection,"Initially, five American cities vied for the 2016 Olympics: Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. The USOC's chairman at the time, Peter Ueberroth, visited all potential host cities during April and May 2006. He visited Chicago on May 10. On July 26, 2006, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) narrowed its list of American applicant cities to three: Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. San Francisco withdrew its application on November 13, 2006 after the San Francisco 49ers pulled out of a deal for the construction of a new stadium that would be the centerpiece of the games.
The final stage of the USOC internal selection occurred on April 14, 2007, at Washington, D.C.'s Embassy Row Hotel, where the two remaining bid cities, Chicago and Los Angeles, made a last 40-minute presentation to the USOC board members. At about 21:00 UTC, Chicago was announced as the winner of the United States bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics by Ueberroth.",216

This is the city's second consecutive bid and its third failure, after two failed attempts for the 1972 and the 2012 Summer Olympics. Geographic issues were highlighted as a major problem for Madrid due to recent Olympic Games in Europe as the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. If successful, it would be the second Olympics hosted in Spain, after the 1992 Summer Olympics held in Barcelona.",379
Madrid bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,Candidature process,"After failing to achieve victory in the election process of the host city of the 2012 Summer Olympics, the city council of Madrid decided to nominate it a candidate to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on July 3, 2006. The nomination was encouraged by statements of the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Jacques Rogge, that European cities would still have a chance to host the 2016 Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched the bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on May 16, 2007. On May 30, 2007, the candidature was formalized by the Spanish Olympic Committee (SOC) with claims to be ""radically new"" and more prepared than the city's last attempt to host the Olympics. The IOC announced that seven cities—Baku, Chicago, Doha, Madrid, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo—were submitted by their respective NOCs to bid for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Madrid bid committee attended the 2016 Applicant Cities' Seminar in Lausanne, Switzerland, on October 18, 2007, where it learnt more about the bidding process. The Application Files, which contain the answers and guarantees requested by the IOC's 2016 Candidature Acceptance Procedure and Questionnaire, were returned by all seven applicant cities to the IOC on January 14, 2008. The responses were studied by the IOC Working Group and the IOC Executive Board, at the latter meeting to decide which cities would be accepted as candidate cities.
On June 4, 2008, the IOC announced that Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro, and Madrid were selected to the next bidding phase, during a meeting in Athens, Greece. This decision was based on a report by a special IOC Working Group of experts, after a thorough technical analysis of the projects presented on the files submitted by the applicant cities. Each city's potential for staging successful Summer Olympics and Paralympics in 2016 was assessed by the Working Group according to eleven criteria: government support, legal issues and public opinion; general infrastructure; sport venues; Olympic village; environment conditions and impact; accommodation; transport concept; safety and security; experience from past sport events; finance; and overall project and legacy. From August 5 - 26, 2008, the bidding committees from the four candidate cities participated in the Olympic Games Observer Program, during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. Madrid officials also followed the completion of the 2008 Summer Paralympics. The IOC announced that it had received the Candidature Files of all four candidate cities on February 12, 2009.

Doha bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,Bid details,"Hassan Ali Bin Ali was named the chairman of the Doha 2016 Olympic Bid Committee. The bid was officially announced October 25, 2007 at a festival on the Doha corniche.  It was only the second serious bid from the Arab World (after Cairo's bid for the 2008 games), and pundits speculated that Doha's chances of being shortlisted were improved for that reason.  More than 1,000 banners and billboards featuring children (future athletes) promoted the bid in Doha, and Doha organized a Youth Ambassador Program designed to reach out with youthful hope and understanding. Qataris aimed to highlight the future of the country's youth by engaging and inspiring them to better understand the wider world, and for the youth of the rest of the world to gain a true picture of Arab culture and hospitality.  US$48 million was budgeted to secure the games. ($44 million from the government)
The centerpiece of the bid was the expansion of the Aspire Zone sports center, which also houses many other facilities.  The Aspire Zone hosted the 2006 Asian Games.  Doha is also planning a new paralympic stadium, although it is uncertain if it will still be constructed since the end of the bid. The Qatar government committed to full financial guarantees that will cover any cost overruns.
With sport as a raison d'etre, Qatar has invested in multimillion-dollar projects to upgrade Doha's infrastructure to premium international standards.
The bid had support from the Gulf Cooperation Council, solidifying regional support from the neighboring states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.  Bid leader Bin Ali stated, ""Our aim is to build support for the bid which will be a bid that the whole Arab world can be proud of."" 86% of people in Doha City and region support the Olympic bid and 95% of residents were aware of the bid, matching most of the other bid cities.",400
Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics and Summer Paralympics was an attempt to bring the Summer Olympic Games to the city of Los Angeles, California in 2024. Following withdrawals by other bidding cities during the 2024 Summer Olympics bidding process that led to just two candidate cities (Los Angeles and Paris), the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics at the same time, with Los Angeles understood to be preferred for 2028. After extended negotiations, Los Angeles agreed to bid for the 2028 Games if certain conditions were met.

Los Angeles was chosen by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) on August 28, 2015, after the Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to back the bid. Los Angeles was the second city submitted by the USOC for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Boston was originally chosen to be the American bid but withdrew on July 27, 2015. Los Angeles also originally bid for the USOC's nomination in late 2014, when Boston was chosen over Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; and San Francisco. This was the third United States summer bid since hosting the Centennial Olympic Games (1996) in Atlanta, previously losing in 2012 and 2016 to London and Rio de Janeiro, respectively.
Los Angeles previously hosted the 1932 Summer Olympics and the 1984 Summer Olympics, and will become the third city – after London and Paris in 2024 – to host the Summer Games three times.

On April 26, 2014, the Southern California Committee for the Olympic Games announced its bid proposal for the 2024 Olympics.  On  July 28, 2015, the USOC contacted Los Angeles about stepping in as a replacement bidder for the 2024 Summer Games after Boston dropped its bid. On September 1, 2015, the LA City Council voted 15–0 to support a bid for the 2024 Olympic Games. The U.S. Olympic Committee finalised its selection moments after the LA City Council's vote. On  January 13, 2016, Los Angeles 2024 committee officials said they were ""thrilled to welcome"" the construction of a $2-billion-plus, state-of-the-art football stadium in Inglewood, California and believed the arrival of one—and perhaps two—NFL teams would bolster its chances. On January 25, 2016, the Los Angeles 2024 committee announced that it planned to place its Olympic Village on the UCLA campus. LA 2024 also announced that media members and some Olympic officials would be housed in a 15-acre residential complex USC planned to build.
On February 16, 2016, LA 2024 unveiled its new logo and slogan, ""Follow the Sun."" On February 23, 2016, more than 88% of Angelenos were in favor of the city's hosting the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games bid, according to a survey conducted by Loyola Marymount University. On March 10, 2016, Los Angeles officials bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics turned their focus to temporary facilities that might be needed.

On September 13, 2016, the LA 2024 bid committee released a two-minute video featuring a montage of local scenes narrated by children talking about their ""dream city"". On September 23, 2016, LA 2024 agreed to terms with the U.S. Olympic Committee on a required but controversial marketing arrangement. The Joint Marketing Program Agreement outlines shared responsibilities—and shared income—between Los Angeles and the USOC. On October 7, 2016, LA 2024 officials again made adjustments to their proposal for the 2024 Summer Olympics, moving half of a large and potentially expensive media center to the USC campus. On October 21, 2016, the LA 2024 bid committee again enlisted U.S. Olympians to help make the case for restoring the Summer Olympics to Los Angeles.
On November 9, 2016, LA 2024 issued a statement noting ""LA 2024 congratulates President-elect Donald J. Trump and appreciates his longstanding support of the Olympic movement in the United States. We strongly believe the Olympics and LA 2024 transcend politics and can help unify our diverse communities and our world."" On November 12, 2016, Mayor Eric Garcetti and six-time gold medalist sprinter Allyson Felix led an LA 2024 presentation to an array of Olympic leaders and sports officials at a general assembly for the Assn. of National Olympic Committees in Doha, Qatar.

On December 2, 2016, LA 2024 released a new budget estimating it would spend $5.3 billion to stage the Games.
On January 2, 2017, Angeleno Olympians and Paralympians rode on the Rose Parade float titled ""Follow the Sun"" to promote the city's bid. On 9 January 2017, LA 2024 issued a report predicting that the mega-sporting event would boost the local economy by $11.2 billion. On January 25, 2017, the Los Angeles City Council gave unanimous final approval for a privately run bid. On February 28, 2017, it was announced that four Hollywood film studios (Disney, Fox, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros.) would be helping promote the Los Angeles bid. On April 20, 2017, the private committee - trying restore the Summer Olympics to Los Angeles -  issued a new set of renderings and videos showing what the Games might look like.
Following the decision to award the 2024 and 2028 games simultaneously, Los Angeles announced that it would consider a bid for the 2028 Games if certain conditions were met. On July 31, 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for the 2028 games, with $1.8 billion of additional funding to support local sport and the Games program. On August 29, 2018, Olympic officials arrived for a two-day visit that included meetings with local organizers and a tour of the city's newest venues.

San Francisco bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,Summary,"San Francisco was one of the cities vying to be the official United States bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Like the Chicago and Los Angeles bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics, San Francisco and the entire San Francisco Bay Area in California touted a compact but regional-participatory focus for its bid, expressing an interest in developing planning partnerships with a large number of neighboring large cities.  Mayor of San Francisco Gavin Newsom announced the bid on September 12, 2005. After failure to secure a venue for use as the main stadium, the bid was withdrawn on November 13, 2006.
San Francisco also bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but came in second place to New York City during the national bidding process, making the 2016 bid their second unsuccessful bid for the Summer Olympics. The San Francisco 2012 bid organizers offered a concept called the ""Ring of Gold"" which took advantage of existing athletic venues from as far as Sacramento but revolved around four compact clusters near public transportation hubs: San Francisco; Palo Alto; San Jose and Santa Clara; Oakland and Berkeley.
Newsom announced on July 11, 2006, that the new bid would be centered on a proposed new San Francisco 49ers stadium in the property on which Candlestick Park stands today. At the same time, he stated that the Olympic Village would be constructed at Hunters Point and that it would be converted into affordable housing following the games. This new Olympic stadium would be necessary as Stanford Stadium, the originally planned venue for athletics and the ceremonies for the 2012 bid, has been replaced by a smaller football stadium.",315
San Francisco bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,Bid history,"On July 26, 2006, the USOC officially named San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago as the three US finalists for the 2016 Olympics, dropping Philadelphia and Houston.
On September 22, 2006, San Francisco submitted a report responding to the USOC questionnaire that was distributed to the remaining three U.S. candidate cities.  On the same day, San Francisco 2016 issued a press release announcing the design of a new stadium for both the 49ers and the Olympics/Paralympics.  The design involves conversion of the football stadium to one including a 400-meter track by elevating the playing field, and also includes provision for expanded seating capacity for events such as the Olympics and Super Bowl.
On November 9, 2006, the San Francisco 49ers ended negotiations with the city of San Francisco for the development of a new football stadium that would also be used as the centerpiece of the 2016 Olympics.  The 49ers would eventually move to nearby city Santa Clara. Bid organizers would have had to create a new plan for a central stadium if the 49ers relocated.",218
Rio 2016 Olympic Village,Summary,"The Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Village, also called the Athletes' Village or Olympic and Paralympic Village, is an accommodation center built to house all participating athletes, as well as officials and athletic trainers of the 2016 Summer Olympics. It is located in Barra da Tijuca, close to City of Sports Complex.
With a capacity of 17,950 people and a total of 3,604 apartments and 31 buildings, it is the largest Olympic Village in the history of the Olympic Games.",104
Rio 2016 Olympic Village,Construction,"In the 1960s, Lagoinha of Rio de Janeiro fishermen did irregular occupations in the Jacapareguá Lagoon forming Vila Autódromo favela. In 1975, because of the construction of the Autódromo International Nelson Piquet and a new upscale neighbourhood, community of Vila Autódromo remained between the walls of the circuit and the margins of the lagoon. In 1994 it was given to more than 60 families property titles because constant threats of eviction by Prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro, local authority of Rio. In the plans that the International Olympic Committee received from the Olympic Games winning bid in 2009, part of Vila Autódromo still appeared in the left upper side of the new City Of Sports Complex, intended to be built in the West Zone of Bar of Tijuca.
Despite the existence of the Vila inhabitants' property titles, Prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro reduced the original size of the community by 83% using expropriations and eviction orders. Afterwards, following constant clashes against the riot police after resisting evictions, families affected formed a civil society called Viva A Vila Autódromo!. They received consultancy of several Rio de Janeiro universities and organisations of the civil society to elaborate Plano Popular da Vila Autódromo (Popular Plan of Vila Autódromo), a plan of urbanisation that was agreed with the mayor of the city, Eduardo Paes, to give to the village a place with a new urban infrastructure that will include a cultural centre and sportive fields and coexist with the new Olympic infrastructure of suitable way, while being surrounded almost completely by the new Olympic park.
New Olympic Village remained in front of Vila Autódromo. Beginning in 2011 constructors Odebrecht and Carvalho Hosken began the construction in an area of more than 1,000,000 square metres (11,000,000 sq ft). In the construction of this village participated more than 18,000 people. They used 430,000 cubic metres (15,000,000 cu ft) of concrete and 43,000 tonnes (47,000 tons) of steel. The buildings received LEED ND environmental certification because 85% of the demolished former communities were reused and the complex has more than 16,000 square metres (170,000 sq ft) of green flat roofs as well as 75 solar plates to warm water. All the installations are designed with complete accessibility with ramps and sufficient elevators.",523
Baku bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,Summary,"Baku 2016 (Azerbaijani: Bakı 2016) was an unsuccessful bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics by Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan. It was the first bid by the city to host the Olympic games.  Baku was eliminated from the running at the announcement of the Candidate city shortlist on June 4, 2008.
If Baku had been chosen to host, the games would have been held between July 15 and July 31, 2016. The Paralympics would have been held between August 10 and August 22.",115
Baku bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,Bid details,"Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, announced its plans to bid for the Olympics, with initial studies suggesting that the cost of hosting the 2016 Summer Olympics may be $20 billion. In July 2007, Chingiz Huseynzade, chairman of Azerbaijan's National Olympic Committee, told a press conference that a group of economists was working on this issue.  Baku is Azerbaijan's oil-rich capital city, on the shores of the Caspian Sea. The city had become somewhat run down following the chaotic period during which independent Azerbaijan emerged from the former Soviet Union but has been experiencing massive development since a new oil-boom began around 2003. As a city in the crossroads between East and West, Huseynzade suggested that the theme of the games might be ""making a better connection between East and West""
In November 2007, the Azerbaijan Organizing Committee established its bid committee, installing first vice premier Yagub Eyubov as head.  To ensure quick turnaround, Sports Minister Azad Ragimov appointed the Caspian American Group to prepare the bid book with the assistance of the government.

 
Recent sports experience included Baku's hosting of the 2007 World Wrestling Championships and the 23rd European Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships at the Heydar Aliyev Sport Complex, named for the former Azeri leader.
The bid was popular with residents, with 91.9% of residents being in favor of the bid.  This was the highest approval rating of any of the applicants, most of which were in the 70s-80s percent range.
One issue that appeals to the IOC is the sports or Olympic legacy of a host nation.  As Azerbaijan has been independent only a short time, naturally, it has a short Olympic history, sending teams since only 1996 and claiming only three gold medalists so far. Meanwhile, its long border with Iran may have caused concerns for a security risk.   However, Iran itself expressed support for the Baku Olympic bid. In addition, the South Caucasus is a region with two other frozen political conflicts, which may have negatively influenced support of the regional Games.",442

Swimming at the 2016 Summer Olympics,Open water quality,"The location for open-water events was a source of concern for athletes since scientists have found microbes in the waters off of Fort Copacabana and drug-resistant super bacteria off the beaches of Rio de Janeiro in 2014 and 2016 studies due to the daily dumping of hospital waste and household raw sewage into the rivers and ocean. Ten percent of the Copacabana water test samples contained drug-resistant super bacteria. However, during the races the water quality was good.",98

Dubai did not submit a bid.",59
Dubai bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,Factors for the bid,"Dubai's economic and structural development was seen to play in its favor. The construction of the Dubai Sports City and a multitude of new hotels - such as the Burj al-Arab - would also boost its chances.
Another factor in favour of the Dubai bid was its location - although this was also a major disadvantage (see below). At the time of bidding, there had never been a host country from South America, Africa, South Asia or the Middle East, leading the International Olympic Committee eager to grant a city in one of these regions the chance to host the Games. However, they were more eager in granting it to poorer nations than the UAE.",137

Bermuda at the 2016 Summer Olympics,Summary,"Bermuda competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. Since the nation's official debut in 1936, Bermudian athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, but did not attend the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the nation's partial support for the US-led boycott.

Swaziland at the 2016 Summer Olympics,Background,"Swaziland participated in ten Summer Olympics between its debut in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The only occasions in that period which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international boycotts of the events. The first boycott was because of the inclusion of the New Zealand team at the Games despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior. In 1980, Swaziland joined with the United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. The highest number of Swazis participating at any one Games was 11 at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. No Swazi has ever won a medal at an Olympics.
The Swaziland Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association selected two athletes using wildcard slots. A National Olympic Committee was able to enter up to three qualified athletes in each individual event at the 2016 Games as long as each athlete met the ""A"" standard, or one athlete per event if they met the ""B"" standard.

Chad at the 2016 Summer Olympics,Background,"Chad participated in 12 Summer Olympics between its debut at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The only occasions in that period which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international boycotts of the events. The first boycott was because of the inclusion of the New Zealand team at the Games despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior. In 1980, Chad joined with the United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.
The highest number of Chadians participating at any one Games was six at both the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. No Chadian has ever won a medal at an Olympics.
The National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Chad (French: Comité Olympique et Sportif Tchadien, COST), selected two athletes using wildcard slots.

Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's 1500 metres,Summary,"Genzebe Dibaba, the world record holder and the 2015 World Champion had an injury affected outdoor season, though she was still the fourth fastest entrant. Faith Kipyegon, the 2015 World runner-up, was the form athlete before the Olympics, being unbeaten and owning the two fastest times for the season – a Kenyan record of 3:56.41 minutes. Laura Muir's British record placed her second on the seasonal rankings. Other top entrants included Ethiopians Dawit Seyaum and Besu Sado, Dutch athlete Sifan Hassan, and American former world medallists Jennifer Simpson, Brenda Martinez and Shannon Rowbury. The 2012 Olympic champion Aslı Çakır Alptekin was absent due to a doping ban, as were five other finalists from 2012, a race ESPN ""one of the dirtiest races in Olympic history.""
There were no surprise eliminations in the first round. Dawit Seyaum won the fastest heat in 4:05.33 minutes, with Kipyegon and Genzebe Dibaba being the other heat winners.
Many of these women were in the World Championship race and the world record run before it.  They had a year to think about and prepare their way to beat Dibaba.  The final started off in a walk for these athletes, the first lap in 1:16.57.  Dibaba went almost to the back of the pack, with the last chaser in her previous major races, Sifan Hassan watching her back and only Laura Muir trailing.  Shannon Rowbury was relegated to the unwanted leader duties until Laura Weightman moved forward near the end of the lap.  After the slow first lap, even Muir tired of jogging at the back and moved forward, but not Dibaba and Hassan.  By the steeplechase pit, 550 metres into the race, Dibaba ran a few quicker steps and moved to the outside, foretelling her move.  Over the next 150 metres, Dibaba floated forward with ease, Hassan following.  Over the next 100 metres, Dibaba cruised to the front, with each of the key figures in the race recognizing she had passed and scrambling to follow.  With a lap and a half to go, Muir was tight on Dibaba's shoulder, followed by Faith Kipyegon, Besu Sado, Jennifer Simpson, Hassan and Rowbury.  Dawit Seyaum came up from behind to join the mix of leaders but all were fighting not to let Dibaba get away.  At the bell, Kipyegon had gotten around Muir and was right on Dibaba's back, a gap had separated between Muir and the next chaser, Hassan.  The third lap was run in 56.80.  Both Dibaba and Kipyegon appeared to be in full sprint, but Kipyegon stuck to Dibaba like glue down the backstretch.  Then with just over 200 to go, Kipyegon accelerated around Dibaba.  Dibaba had no answer.  Kipyegon continued to extend her lead on to the finish line.  Behind them was the battle for bronze.  With 150 to go, Hassan caught Muir but Simpson was right on her back and Rowbury was gaining from behind.  Coming off the turn, Simpson went into her sprint, which left Hassan behind.  Rowbury also ran past Hassan and followed Simpson to the line.  Dibaba tied up badly going in to the finish, with Simpson rapidly gaining, but the finish line arrived for Dibaba faster than a sprinting Simpson could get there.
Kipyegon ran her last 800 in 1:57.2, even faster than Dibaba ran her last 800 in Beijing.

The sole woman, Margret Rumat Hassan, was given a spot eight days prior to the start of the Games that had been allotted previously to Mangar Makur Chuot.

In 1976, the British Solomon Islands Protectorate won the right to self-government, and declared independence in 1978 under the name Solomon Islands. The nation fell into a period of civil instability between then and 2003, when Australia led a multi-disciplinary mission, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) to restore law and order in the country.
The Solomon Islands participated in nine Summer Olympics between their debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The highest number of Solomon Islanders participating any single Summer Games was four at the 1988, 1996, and 2012 Summer Olympics. No Solomon Islander has ever won a medal at any Games.

""Chinese Taipei"" is the designated name used by Taiwan to participate in some international organizations and almost all sporting events, including the Olympic Games. Neither the common name ""Taiwan"" nor the official name ""Republic of China"" would be used due primarily to opposition from the People's Republic of China.

Independent Olympians at the Olympic Games,Precursors,"Prior to the 1906 Intercalated Games, entry was not restricted to teams nominated by National Olympic Committees (NOCs). Mixed-nationality teams competed in some team events. Participants in individual events are retrospectively credited to their nationality of the time.
The 1940 Winter Olympics was reassigned to Garmisch-Partenkirchen in spring 1939. In concert with Nazi German claims on Czechoslovakia, the organisers refused to recognise the Czechoslovakia NOC; however they were prepared to allow its athletes to enter under the Olympic flag. In any event, the Games were cancelled because of World War II.
During the Cold War, some athletes who emigrated from Soviet Bloc countries were unable to compete at the Olympics, as their original state's NOC neither wanted them on its own team nor gave them permission to transfer nationality. Some applied to compete as individuals in 1952 and 1956 but were refused.
When Guyana joined the 1976 Olympic boycott, its sprinter James Gilkes asked the IOC to be allowed to compete as an individual, but was refused.
The IOC first made provisions for athletes to compete under the Olympic flag in time for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Some NOCs, mostly from Western Europe, wished to attend the Games despite their governments' support for the American-led boycott in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The NOCs hesitated to use national symbols without government approval, so the IOC relaxed this requirement: 14 NOCs competed under the Olympic flag, while three, New Zealand, Spain and Portugal, competed under their respective NOCs' flag.",329

The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1928 (when no shooting events were held) and 1908; it was nominally open to women from 1968 to 1980, although very few women participated these years. The first five events were quite different, with some level of consistency finally beginning with the 1932 event—which, though it had differences from the 1924 competition, was roughly similar. The 1936 competition followed the 1932 one quite closely. The post-World War II event substantially altered the competition once again. The 1984 Games introduced women's-only shooting events, including the ISSF 25 meter pistol (though this is more similar to the non-Olympic men's ISSF 25 meter center-fire pistol than the rapid fire pistol).

Since the nation's official debut in 1952, Thai athletes had appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, because of its support of the US-led boycott.
The National Olympic Committee of Thailand fielded a team of 54 athletes, 26 men and 28 women, to compete in fifteen sports at the Games.

Russia at the 2016 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The Russian Federation competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was Russia's sixth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics as an independent nation. The nation finished fourth in the medal standings, with 19 gold and 56 total medals, ensuring that Soviet and Russian athletes had never placed below fourth since they started participating in 1952.
On 18 July 2016, an independent investigation commissioned by World Anti-Doping Agency concluded that it was shown ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that the RUSADA, the Ministry of Sport, the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Centre of Sports Preparation of the National Teams of Russia had ""operated for the protection of doped Russian athletes"" within a ""state-directed failsafe system"" using ""the disappearing positive [test] methodology."" According to the McLaren Report, the Disappearing Positive Methodology operated from ""at least late 2011 to August 2015."" It was used on 643 positive samples, a number that the authors consider ""only a minimum"" due to limited access to Russian records. Based on these findings the International Olympic Committee called for an emergency meeting to consider banning Russia from the Summer Olympics.
On 24 July, the IOC rejected WADA's recommendation to ban Russia from the Summer Olympics and announced that a decision would be made by each sport federation with each positive decision having to be approved by a CAS arbitrator. On 7 August 2016, the IOC cleared 278 athletes, while 111 were removed because of the scandal.
On 7 August 2016, the International Paralympic Committee announced that it had voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian Paralympic team from competing at the 2016 Summer Paralympics, in the wake of a larger scandal that exposed the participation of Russian Olympic and Paralympic athletes in a state-sponsored doping program.
On 8 December 2016, silver medalist Misha Aloyan was found to have committed an anti-doping rule violation after testing positive for Tuaminoheptane, a specified stimulant, prohibited in-competition under S6 on the WADA Prohibited List, during an in-competition doping control on 21 August 2016. The results obtained by the athlete at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games were disqualified.
On 9 December 2016, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren published the second part of his independent report. The investigation claimed that from 2011 to 2015, more than 1,000 Russian competitors in various sports (including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports) were involved in a cover-up. Emails indicate that athletes who tested positive for banned substances included five blind powerlifters, who may have been given drugs without their knowledge, and a fifteen-year-old.",552
